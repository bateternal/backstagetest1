# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

This section answers the most commonly asked questions about the Backstage Test Project.

## General Questions

### What is the Backstage Test Project?

The Backstage Test Project is a comprehensive Django application designed to demonstrate various documentation patterns and best practices for Backstage integration. It serves as a learning resource and practical reference for developers working with Backstage.

### Who should use this project?

This project is ideal for:
- Developers learning Backstage
- Teams implementing Backstage in their organizations
- Anyone looking for documentation examples
- Developers working with Django and Backstage integration

### Is this project production-ready?

This project is designed as a **learning and demonstration tool**. While it includes production-like patterns and configurations, it should not be used directly in production without proper security review and customization.

## Installation Questions

### What Python version do I need?

You need Python 3.8 or higher. Python 3.11+ is recommended for the best experience.

### Can I use a different database?

Yes! The project supports multiple databases:
- **SQLite** (default for development)
- **PostgreSQL** (recommended for production)
- **MySQL** (supported)

See the [Configuration Guide](../getting-started/configuration.md) for setup instructions.

### Do I need Docker?

Docker is optional but recommended for:
- Consistent development environments
- Easy deployment
- Production-like testing

You can run the project without Docker using the standard Python setup.

### Why is my virtual environment not working?

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Wrong Python version**: Make sure you're using Python 3.8+
2. **Path issues**: Ensure the virtual environment is properly activated
3. **Permission issues**: Check file permissions in the project directory

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md) for detailed solutions.

## Backstage Integration Questions

### How does the Backstage integration work?

The project integrates with Backstage through:
- **Catalog Info**: `catalog-info.yaml` defines the service metadata
- **TechDocs**: Documentation is served through Backstage's TechDocs feature
- **API Discovery**: APIs are automatically discovered and cataloged
- **Health Checks**: Service health is monitored by Backstage

### Do I need a running Backstage instance?

For full functionality, yes. However, you can:
- Run the Django application independently
- Use the documentation locally with MkDocs
- Test API endpoints without Backstage

### How do I connect to my Backstage instance?

Update the `BACKSTAGE_URL` in your environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
BACKSTAGE_URL=http://your-backstage-instance.com
```

### What Backstage features are demonstrated?

This project demonstrates:
- Service cataloging
- TechDocs integration
- API documentation
- Health monitoring
- Component relationships
- Dependency tracking

## Development Questions

### How do I add new features?

1. Create a feature branch
2. Implement your changes
3. Add tests
4. Update documentation
5. Submit a pull request

See the [Contributing Guide](../contributing/guidelines.md) for detailed instructions.

### What testing framework is used?

The project uses:
- **pytest** for unit and integration tests
- **pytest-django** for Django-specific testing
- **coverage** for code coverage analysis
- **factory-boy** for test data generation

### How do I run the tests?

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report

# Run specific test
python manage.py test myapp.tests.TestClass.test_method
```

### What code quality tools are used?

- **flake8** for linting
- **black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **mypy** for type checking
- **pre-commit** for automated checks

## API Questions

### How do I get an API token?

1. Create a user account
2. Log in to the Django admin
3. Navigate to Users â†’ API Tokens
4. Create a new token
5. Use the token in API requests

### What API endpoints are available?

The API provides endpoints for:
- User management (`/api/v1/users/`)
- Project management (`/api/v1/projects/`)
- Component management (`/api/v1/components/`)
- Health checks (`/api/v1/health/`)

See the [API Documentation](../api/overview.md) for complete details.

### How do I handle API errors?

The API returns structured error responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "details": {
      "field": "email",
      "issue": "Invalid email format"
    }
  }
}
```

### Is there rate limiting?

Yes, the API implements rate limiting:
- **Authenticated users**: 1000 requests/hour
- **Unauthenticated users**: 100 requests/hour

Rate limit headers are included in responses.

## Documentation Questions

### How is the documentation structured?

The documentation follows Backstage TechDocs best practices:
- **MkDocs** for static site generation
- **Material theme** for modern UI
- **Mermaid diagrams** for visual content
- **Structured navigation** for easy browsing

### Can I customize the documentation?

Yes! The documentation is fully customizable:
- Modify `docs/mkdocs.yml` for configuration
- Add new pages in the `docs/` directory
- Customize the theme and styling
- Add plugins and extensions

### How do I build the documentation locally?

```bash
# Install MkDocs
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

# Serve locally
mkdocs serve

# Build static site
mkdocs build
```

### How do I add new documentation pages?

1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate directory
2. Add the page to `docs/mkdocs.yml` navigation
3. Use proper markdown formatting
4. Include diagrams and examples
